# Project Title : Bank Customer Churn Model

## What is Bank Customer Churn Model ?
A bank customer churn model is a predictive model that attempts to identify customers who are likely to stop doing business with a bank.

This is valuable to banks because it allows them to take proactive steps to retain those customers, such as:

Offering them special promotions. Reaching out to them to address any concerns.

## What is Churn?
In the context of banking, churn refers to the phenomenon of customers closing their accounts or ending their relationship with a bank.

It's like when you switch phone providers or cancel a subscription service.

For banks, high churn rates can be problematic as it means losing valuable customers and potential revenue.

## Why is churn prediction important?

1) Customer Retention: Identifying customers at risk of churn allows banks to proactively engage with them and potentially prevent them from leaving. This can lead to increased customer retention and loyalty.

2) Revenue Protection: Losing customers means losing their associated revenue streams. By predicting churn, banks can take steps to retain those customers and protect their revenue.

3) Cost Savings: Acquiring new customers is generally more expensive than retaining existing ones. Churn prediction helps reduce customer acquisition costs by focusing on retaining valuable customers.

4) Improved Customer Experience: Understanding the factors that drive churn can help banks identify areas for improvement in their products, services, and overall customer experience.

5) Competitive Advantage: Effective churn prediction can give banks a competitive edge by allowing them to retain customers more effectively than their competitors.

## Objectives :
1) This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict bank customer churn.

2) The objective is to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank, allowing the bank to take proactive measures to retain them.

3) This can be achieved by analyzing customer data and identifying patterns that indicate a high risk of churn.
